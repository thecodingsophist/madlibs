# madlibs
A simple mad libs game written in python! (CS1.1-Term1-MakeSchool)

UPDATE (9/9/2018) madlibs-extra-edition is almost done, it has all features except the trawling through newswebsites for good articles. The problem with trawling through newswebsites is that sometimes the articles may be inappropriate or too long to read. Which is why I have selected two pieces to mash up in the example code. Another problem with the examples I have chosen is that even though the sentences are correct, in that they have the right parts of sentences, they may not make much sense. Over all, this was fun to code, although the results are a bit disappointing in that it is difficult to make sense of new texts. 

BEGIN! madlibs.py is a piece of code that shows string interpolation. Which is the only exciting thing about it. 

madlibs-extra-edition is an idea that will eventually use NLP, randomization, and a news trawler to write interesting madlib-ey fake news. A lot more interesting and a work in progress.
