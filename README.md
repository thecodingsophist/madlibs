# madlibs
A simple mad libs game written in python! (CS1.1-Term1-MakeSchool)

madlibs.py is a piece of code that shows string interpolation. Which is the only exciting thing about it. 

madlibs-extra-edition is an idea that will eventually use NLP, randomization, and a news trawler to write interesting madlib-ey fake news. A lot more interesting and a work in progress.
